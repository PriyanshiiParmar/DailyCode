***********************Problem********************
As part of the New Year celebrations, a magical mirror has been set up in the town square. The mirror has the power to reveal if a phrase is perfectly 
balanced—a palindrome that reads the same forward and backward. To use the mirror, townsfolk must process their phrases by converting all uppercase letters 
into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters (letters and numbers only).

Can you help the townsfolk check if their phrases are perfect reflections?

Input Format

The first line contains T, the number of test cases.
For each test case:
A single line contains a string s, representing the phrase to check.
Constraints

1≤s.length≤2×10^5
s consists only of printable ASCII characters.
Output Format

For each test case, output "true" if the phrase is a palindrome and "false" otherwise.
Sample Input 0

1
A man, a plan, a canal: Panama  
Sample Output 0

true  
Explanation 0

Test Case 1: The phrase "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" is processed by: Converting all uppercase letters to lowercase. Removing spaces, punctuation, 
and any non-alphanumeric characters. The resulting string is "amanaplanacanalpanama", which reads the same forward and backward. Therefore, the output is "true".

Sample Input 1

1
race a car
Sample Output 1

false
Explanation 1

Test Case 2: The phrase "race a car" is processed similarly: Converting to lowercase. Removing spaces and non-alphanumeric characters. The resulting string
is "raceacar", which does not read the same forward and backward. Therefore, the output is "false".

Sample Input 2

1
" "
Sample Output 2

true
Explanation 2

Test Case 3: The phrase " " (a single space) is processed by: Removing all non-alphanumeric characters, leaving an empty string "". An empty string is
considered a palindrome because it reads the same forward and backward. Therefore, the output is "true".
