******************************************************Problem***************************************
A flock of n birds is migrating through an infinitely vast sky. Each bird is flying at the same speed 
but in one of three possible states:

'L': The bird is flying towards the left.
'R': The bird is flying towards the right.
'S': The bird is hovering in place.
You are given a 0-indexed string directions of length n, where directions[i] represents the state of the i-th bird.
Each bird is positioned at a unique location in the sky along a single migration path.

A collision occurs when:

Two birds flying in opposite directions (one 'L' and one 'R') crash into each other. 
This increases the number of collisions by 2, and the birds become stationary.
A moving bird collides with a stationary (hovering) bird ('S'). This increases the number of collisions
by 1, and the moving bird also becomes stationary.
After a collision, birds involved in the crash stop moving and remain in place. Other birds continue 
their motion unless they also collide.

Determine the total number of collisions that will happen in the sky.

Input Format

The first line contains T, the number of test cases.
Each of the next T lines contains a string directions, representing the movement of birds.
Constraints

1≤T≤1000
1≤∣directions∣≤10^5
Each character in directions is either 'L', 'R', or 'S'.
Output Format

For each test case, print the total number of mid-air collisions.

Sample Input 0

RLRSLL
Sample Output 0

5
Explanation 0

The collisions that will happen in the sky are:

Birds 0 ('R') and 1 ('L') crash head-on, causing 2 collisions.
Birds 2 ('R') and 3 ('S') collide, adding 1 collision (total: 3).
Birds 3 ('S') and 4 ('L') collide, adding 1 collision (total: 4).
Birds 4 ('L') and 5 ('L') collide (after 4 becomes stationary), adding 1 collision (total: 5).
Thus, the total number of collisions that will happen is 5.

Sample Input 1

2
SSSS
SRSRS
Sample Output 1

0
2
Explanation 1

SSSS → No movement, no collisions. Thus, the total number of collisions that will happen is 0.

SRSRS →

Bird 1 ('R') collides with 2 ('S') → 1 collision.
Bird 3 ('R') collides with 4 ('S') → 1 collision.
Thus, the total number of collisions that will happen is 2.
