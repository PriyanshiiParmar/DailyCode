****************************************Problem**********************************
You manage an electric vehicle (EV) charging station with three types of chargers: slow, medium, and fast.
Each second, you can either charge two vehicles using different types of chargers or one vehicle using any single type of charger.

You are given a 0-indexed integer array amount of length 3 where:

amount[0] represents the number of vehicles needing a slow charger.
amount[1] represents the number of vehicles needing a medium charger.
amount[2] represents the number of vehicles needing a fast charger.
Print the minimum number of seconds required to charge all the vehicles.

Input Format

The first line contains T, the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of an integer array amount of length 3, where:
amount[0] denotes the number of vehicles needing a slow charger.
amount[1] denotes the number of vehicles needing a medium charger.
amount[2] denotes the number of vehicles needing a fast charger.
Constraints

1 <= T <= 1000
amount.length == 3
0 <= amount[i] <= 100
Output Format

For each test case, print the minimum number of seconds required to charge all the vehicles.

Sample Input 0

1  
1 4 2
Sample Output 0

4
Explanation 0

One way to charge the vehicles is:

Second 1: Charge a vehicle with a slow charger and a medium charger.
Second 2: Charge a vehicle with a medium charger and a fast charger.
Second 3: Charge a vehicle with a medium charger and a fast charger.
Second 4: Charge a vehicle with a medium charger.
It can be proven that 4 is the minimum number of seconds needed.
