****************************************Problem**********************************
A group of n friends is enjoying a picnic by the riverbank. They sit in a circle 
around a big picnic mat, numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.

To add some excitement to their day, they decide to play a passing game with a frisbee:

The game starts with friend 1 holding the frisbee.
Moving clockwise, they pass the frisbee k times, counting the friend they start with.
If they reach the last person in the circle, they continue from the first person again.
The friend who receives the frisbee on the kth pass is out of the game and goes to relax by the river.
The next round starts with the friend immediately clockwise of the one who left.
This continues until only one friend is left, who is declared the winner of the game!
Input Format

The first line contains T, the number of test cases.
Each test case contains two integers n and k, representing the number of friends and the count number, respectively.
Constraints

1 <= T <= 1000
1 <= k <= n <= 500
Output Format

For each test case, print the number of the last friend remaining in the game.

Sample Input 0

1
5 2
Sample Output 0

3
Explanation 0

The elimination sequence follows these steps:

Start at friend 1. Pass the frisbee 2 times (1 → 2). Friend 2 steps out to relax.
Start at friend 3. Pass the frisbee 2 times (3 → 4). Friend 4 steps out.
Start at friend 5. Pass the frisbee 2 times (5 → 1). Friend 1 steps out.
Start at friend 3. Pass the frisbee 2 times (3 → 5). Friend 5 steps out.
Friend 3 is the last one left and wins the game!
Sample Input 1

1
6 5
Sample Output 1

1
Explanation 1

The elimination sequence follows as 5 → 4 → 6 → 2 → 3. The last friend remaining is friend 1, who wins the game!
